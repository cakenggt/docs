## Contributing

There's a lot of work to be done on the documentation, so this is a great place for beginners to get started with Eve. From fixing typos to adding examples, work needs to be done across the board here. Check out the [issues](https://github.com/witheve/docs/issues) for a place to start, as they have been raised already as points of improvement by the community. If someone is already assigned and the issue has been aroud a while, check to see if it's being worked on before starting it yourself. Or, if you find an issue yourself, please report it so others know it exists. Thank you!
